The difference between model 1 and model 2 is the epoch.
For model 1, the epoch is 10. For model 2, the epoch is 5.
the validation accuracy for model 1 is 91%
the validation accuracy for model 2 is 87%
We know that when the epochs increases, more number of times the weight are balanced in the network. 
In this way, the network is developing from underfitting to optimal to overfitting.
When epoch is 5, the network is a little bit underfitting. From my test, I suppose 10 is a great value of epoch.
The validation accuracy will decrease if the epochs are too high.
